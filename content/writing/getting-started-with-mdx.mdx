# Getting Started with MDX in Next.js

MDX is a powerful format that allows you to write JSX in your markdown files. This makes it perfect for creating rich, interactive documentation and blog posts.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It combines the simplicity of markdown with the power of React components.

## Setting Up MDX

To set up MDX in your Next.js application, you need to:

1. Install the necessary packages
2. Configure your components
3. Create utility functions
4. Set up your content structure

## Benefits of Using MDX

- **Interactive Content**: Embed React components directly in your markdown
- **Reusable Components**: Create custom components for consistent styling
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support when configured properly
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering with Next.js

## Example Usage

Here's how you can use MDX in your Next.js application:

```jsx
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote-client/rsc'
import { mdxComponents } from '@/lib/mdx-components'

export default function Post({ source, frontmatter }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={mdxComponents} />
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

MDX is a great way to create rich, interactive content in your Next.js application. It combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity of markdown and the power of React components.
